# Code of Conduct

Of course, working on open source together can prove to be difficult at times, All I ask is that everyone be treated equally.
Be patient and understanding or ask for clarification if anything is unclear. Should anything require immediate attention, please
send me [an email](mailto:sidneyliebrand@gmail.com) and it will be looked into ASAP.

# Opening an issue

When you've found something that doesn't work, visit the [issues](issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) page to check wether no such issue already exists.
If your issue doesn't exist, open a new [issue](issues/new) and add the "bug" label.
There is already some template information there but you can (and probably should) add more context / information as required.

# Requesting a feature

Think you've got a good idea for mkdx? Visit the [issues](issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature-request) page
and check to see if someone didn't already beat you to it :)
If your feature isn't requested yet, open a new [issue](issues/new) and add the label "feature-request".
The template is mostly useful for bugs since it requires some information about the issuer's computer and a reproducible example.
Therefore, you are free to clear out the template and just start describing your feature.
It is very helpful to include a graphical example, with that I mean that one can include a "before" snippet
and an "after" snippet of what (s)he wishes to accomplish.

# Sending pull requests

- Open a new GitHub pull request with your patch.
- Make sure that the description includes the problem scenario and the solution, include any relevant issue number.
- That's it, send your patch!
